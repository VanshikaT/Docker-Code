This file contains the components of Docker.

### Image
It is the read-only template. As we cannot provide the running containers to the user, hence we build and deploy the images.

### Container
It is the running instance of the image.

### Docker Engine
It is used to create, manage, and run the images and containers.

### Docker File
It has the instructions to build an image. Docker dont have any built-in feature for building an image, thus it follow the instructions given in the docker file.

### Docker Hub
It is an online registry to share images.

### Docker Compose
It is used when we want to work with multiple Containers.
